# PIG
Piscis Identification Gauge

### What is it? 

A database of Montana FWP Fish Survey Data, with functions to find where big fish (aka Pigs) are

### Motivations
I wanted a more easily navigable data base becasue their website api is a tad clunky and makes it hard to search across large regions for Pigs
